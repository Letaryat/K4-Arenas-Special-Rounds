> [!CAUTION]
> Rounds in this folder are only working with specific version of K4-Arenas that have API method named **GetPlayerWeaponPreferences()**. At the time of writing this method is not officialy in K4-Arenas itself. It is needed to take player weapon preferences and use them as a main weapon instead of giving a one that is hard-coded in the plugin itself.
